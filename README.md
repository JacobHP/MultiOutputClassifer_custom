# MultiOutputClassifer_custom

This is a version of the sklearn MultiOutputClassifier that allows customisable parameters for individual targets. This gets rid of the 'one-size-fits-all' assumption of the sklearn version. 

I used this (with some additional personalisation) in the early stages of the Kaggle MoA competition to play around with using different parameters on different targets with some simpler models such as LR, SVMs and GBDTs.

Note: I haven't added any defensive programming yet. Will probably do this at some point.
